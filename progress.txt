# Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender

## 1. Core Concept

**Implementation Status: 78% Complete**  

### Key Themes Progress:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Urban defense gameplay with district-based missions
- Ship/foot combat transitions via pilot ejection system
- Human rescue mechanics with landers and mutants
- Escalating difficulty through wave systems and boss encounters
- **Defend and Reclaim**: Districts exist in three states (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied)
- **Squad Leader Fantasy (Core Loop):** On-foot aura, formation follow, and sacrifice/body-block behaviors
- **Active Deployment:** Humans convert into operatives when dropped at the hangar
- **Mothership Finale Structure:** Exterior boss breach transitions into an interior pilot-only boarding phase

⚠️ **Partially Implemented:**
- **Seamless transition (Ship/Foot):** Ejection + hangar rebuild + squad leader aura exist, but Bulwark/ground synergies and stronger UI messaging are missing.
- **Resource vs. Score (The Rescue Loop):** Cargo collection + deployment are in place; operative overflow scaling now routes max-tier pickups into comrade buffs with HUD/FX, but deeper squad synergy feedback loops still need polish.
- **Strategic Territory Control:** District states, timers, and prosperity investment are in; still needs tuning/balance.
- **Operative Depth:** 4 distinct classes exist with combat behaviors (Infantry, Gunner, Medic, Saboteur); Tier Overflow scaling now boosts ground troops, but stronger fire-team coordination outside of the on-foot formation is still minimal.

## MVP Completion

- **Status:** ~84% complete (core mission loop, district strategy pressure, and mothership multi-phase finale are implemented; remaining work is mostly design-depth and reward-loop parity).
- **Primary Blockers:** pilot unlock track compliance, assault reward/jackpot loop, Bulwark structural siege payoff, and challenge-mode surfacing.

## Gap Analysis & Next Steps (Codebase + Design Document Audit)

### Overall Completion Statistics
- **Design Document Alignment:** ~82% (the combat/game-state core is strong, but design-specific progression/reward layers are still incomplete).
- **Major Milestones Achieved:** district-state campaign with threatened→critical→occupied pressure, prosperity/loss-aversion reset loop, rescue cargo inertia + hangar deployment into classed operatives, ship destruction -> pilot rebuild flow, supply-drop meta economy with persistent history/pending drops, assault + mothership interior objective chain, and broad defensive automated tests for combat edge cases.
- **Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order):** (1) pilot progression compliance package, (2) assault rewards + jackpot identity, (3) Bulwark siege role implementation, (4) challenge-mode productization (Last Stand / Assault Only), (5) world-reactivity pass (weather + district destruction readability).
- **Estimated Remaining Work:** ~8-12 dev days to hit MVP-quality design compliance; ~3-5 additional weeks for full v2.0 depth + polish.
- **Post-MVP Polish (Optional):** adaptive music intensity layers, cinematic district transition stingers, richer deployment VO/SFX, deeper autonomous fire-team tactics, biome hazard variants, and broader replay mutators.
- **MVP Completion:** ~84%
- **Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance:** persistent pilot unlock catalog/ribbon loop, assault base-clear jackpots + mystery outcomes, Bulwark structural DPS identity, fully surfaced challenge modes with score persistence, and weather/reactive world-state presentation.

### Design Document Alignment
**Aligned / Implemented**
- Strategic district map loop with Friendly/Threatened/Critical/Occupied progression and mission routing.
- Prosperity investment + explicit loss-on-occupation behavior.
- Rescue/carry/deploy loop with cargo-weight inertia and hangar conversion into operatives.
- On-foot recovery loop (pilot ejection + rebuild pressure) and operative class support roles (including medic/saboteur behavior).
- Mothership assault arc with exterior phase and pilot-only interior objective progression.
- Supply-drop purchase/unboxing/pending inventory flow and mission-start hot-start application.

**Partially Aligned**
- Pilot combat systems exist (multiple weapon behaviors, ammo state objects, power-up decay), but design-doc persistent pilot unlock track/ribbon clarity is not fully surfaced.
- Bulwark exists as a mode/handling identity, but structural siege payoff and clear assault-specific messaging are still missing.
- Interior mission framework is live, but design-doc authored interior encounter flavor/readability can still be expanded.
- Environment variety is broad (multiple biomes/interior generators), but weather/time-of-day reactivity is not implemented.

**Not Yet Aligned (Major Gaps)**
- Assault clear rewards/jackpot loop (including stronger post-clear reward presentation).
- Full challenge-mode surfacing and dedicated score persistence UX.
- Weather + destruction-state reactivity layer.

### Major Milestones Achieved
- District campaign state machine, urgency timers, and critical window handling.
- Defense/assault mission scaffolding with objective-based progression.
- Mothership exterior->interior transition and interior objective chain.
- Operative deployment ecosystem (spawn classes, support behavior, follow/aura hooks).
- Supply-drop economy/state persistence and shop integration.
- Regression safety net of 40 passing automated tests around weapon/projectile/interior/enemy edge cases.

### Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance
1. **Pilot Progression Compliance:** Persistent pilot unlock offers and district-layer progression signaling (including clearer HUD identity for pilot weapon ownership/tier).
2. **Assault Rewards & Mystery/Jackpot Outcomes:** Base-clear loot/jackpot outcomes tied to assault completion with visible reward callouts.
3. **Bulwark Assault Synergy:** Structural damage bonus/interaction rules and live UI/FX confirmation while active.
4. **Challenge Mode Productization:** Last Stand and Assault Only as first-class menu options with score tracking/reporting.
5. **World Reactivity Layer:** Weather/time-of-day and stronger district destruction-state presentation beats.

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)
1. **Pilot progression completion sprint (2-3 days)**  
   - Add persistent pilot unlock catalog + district-facing progression indicator.  
   - Finish pilot weapon HUD/readability loop and ensure mission-level reinforcement behavior is explicit.

2. **Assault reward identity sprint (2 days)**  
   - Implement base-clear reward/jackpot tables and clear payout presentation (mission summary + in-run callout).

3. **Bulwark siege pass (1-2 days)**  
   - Add structural DPS/siege interactions and mode-active visual telemetry.

4. **Challenge mode surfacing sprint (2 days)**  
   - Ship Last Stand / Assault Only selectors and score persistence/reporting.

5. **World-reactivity pass (2-3 days)**  
   - Introduce weather/time-of-day hooks and occupied-district destruction readability polish.

### Estimated Remaining Work

### MVP Completion
- **Current Progress:** ~84%
- **Remaining Critical Work:**
  - Pilot progression compliance: 2-3 days
  - Assault rewards + jackpot outcomes: 2 days
  - Bulwark siege synergy + HUD/FX feedback: 1-2 days
  - Challenge mode surfacing + score persistence: 2 days
- **Total to MVP target:** ~8-12 days (including QA/balance buffer)

### Full Design Document
- **High Priority Remaining:** ~16%
  - Pilot progression package and on-foot identity clarity
  - Assault reward economy and Bulwark assault identity
  - Challenge-mode experience surfacing
- **Medium Priority Remaining:** ~35%
  - Weather/destruction reactivity systems
  - Adaptive audio and cinematic urgency polish
  - Deeper autonomous fire-team coordination
- **Low Priority Remaining:** ~65%
  - Leaderboard/mutator expansion
  - District archetype and long-tail replay content growth

### Post-MVP Polish (Optional)
- Adaptive music layers tied to urgency and encounter phase changes.
- Cinematic transition stingers for district fail/recover/liberate states.
- Expanded deployment feedback (radio chatter sets, class-specific VO/SFX).
- Challenge mutators and richer leaderboard segmentation.
- Biome-specific hazards and replay-variance events.

### What We Should Work On Next (Recommended Focus)
The next best move is to **ship the pilot progression compliance package first**, because it closes the largest design-doc identity gap while leveraging systems that already exist (weapons, ammo state, district urgency, and shop/meta persistence).

**Recommended execution order:**
1. Pilot progression + pilot HUD clarity.
2. Assault clear rewards/jackpot emotional payoff.
3. Bulwark structural siege identity.
4. Challenge mode surfacing with score persistence.
5. Weather/reactivity presentation layer.
