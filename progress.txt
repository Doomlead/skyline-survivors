# Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender

## 1. Core Concept

**Implementation Status: 78% Complete**  

### Key Themes Progress:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Urban defense gameplay with district-based missions
- Ship/foot combat transitions via pilot ejection system
- Human rescue mechanics with landers and mutants
- Escalating difficulty through wave systems and boss encounters
- **Defend and Reclaim**: Districts exist in three states (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied)
- **Squad Leader Fantasy (Core Loop):** On-foot aura, formation follow, and sacrifice/body-block behaviors

⚠️ **Partially Implemented:**
- **Seamless transition (Ship/Foot):** Ejection + hangar rebuild + squad leader aura exist, but Bulwark/ground synergies and stronger UI messaging are missing.
- **Resource vs. Score (The Rescue Loop):** Cargo collection + deployment are in place, but tier overflow and squad synergy feedback are missing.
- **Strategic Territory Control:** District states and timers exist, but the "Loss Aversion" investment mechanics are missing.
- **Operative Depth:** 4 distinct classes exist with combat behaviors (Infantry, Gunner, Medic, Saboteur), but long-range fire team coordination outside of the on-foot formation and Tier Overflow scaling are missing.

## Gap Analysis & Next Steps

### Overall Completion Statistics
- **MVP Completion:** ~75% (Core rescue/deploy loop, on-foot aura, and district flow are playable.)
- **Design Document Alignment:** ~70% (Key systems exist, but several signature design mechanics are missing.)
- **Major Milestones Achieved:** Rescue/Deploy loop, district states, assault/defense modes, hangar rebuild, operative spawning + formation + sacrifice behaviors, supply drop unboxing.

### Design Document Alignment
**Aligned/Implemented**
- District state system (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied).
- Rescue-to-Deploy loop (cargo carry, inertia, hangar drop-off, operative deployment).
- Assault/Defense mission flows with hangar rebuild loop.
- On-foot squad aura + sacrifice behavior.

**Partially Aligned**
- Operative depth (classes exist; patrol behavior exists; missing squad upgrades from weapon overflow).
- Strategic layer urgency (Threatened/Occupied exists; critical urgency and pulse exist, missing explicit near-miss/clutch bonus).
- Shop loop (Supply Drop unboxing exists; hot-start application missing).

**Not Aligned**
- Prosperity/loss aversion investment system.
- Combo/urgency feedback loops (combo meter, clutch defense bonus).
- Tier 3 overflow upgrades for operatives.
- Assault rewards and mystery drops.

### Major Milestones Achieved
- Ship/foot transition with pilot ejection and hangar rebuild.
- Cargo-based inertia and operative deployment.
- On-foot aura + body-blocking sacrifice loop.
- Assault base objective with garrisons/turrets/shield nodes.
- Supply Drop shop, unboxing, and pending drop display.

### Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance
1. **Weapon Tier Overflow:** Redirect max-tier ship pickups to comrade scaling.
2. **Strategic Pressure Systems:** Prosperity/loss aversion, explicit near-miss clutch bonus, combo meter.
3. **Supply Drop Hot-Starts:** Apply pending supply drops to the next deployment and clear correctly.
4. **Bulwark Assault Synergy:** Higher structural damage or siege bonuses.
5. **Assault Loot Rewards & Mystery Drops:** Base destruction rewards and random jackpots.

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)
**Priority 1: Wire Supply Drop Hot-Starts (1-2 Days)**
- Apply `pendingDrop` bonuses at mission start and clear them when consumed.
- Add mission-start HUD callout for applied bonuses.

**Priority 2: Weapon Tier Overflow → Operative Buffs (2-3 Days)**
- Detect max-tier pickups and redirect to ground troops (damage/fire rate/HP).
- Add FX/HUD feedback for comrade upgrades.

**Priority 3: Strategic Pressure & Near-Miss Clutch Bonus (2 Days)**
- Add explicit 30s "CRITICAL" near-miss window.
- Add clutch defense bonus and combo meter to reinforce urgency.

**Priority 4: Bulwark Assault Synergy + Assault Rewards (2-3 Days)**
- Add structural damage bonus for Bulwark mode.
- Add assault base loot drops and mystery jackpots.

**Priority 5: Mothership & Campaign Polish (4 Days)**
- Continue with the multi-phase Mothership boss as planned (endgame).
- Balance Mothership pacing, UI polish, and feedback passes.

### Estimated Remaining Work
- **Supply Drop Hot-Starts + HUD Feedback:** 2 days
- **Weapon Overflow & Comrade Buff Feedback:** 3 days
- **Strategic Pressure Systems (Near-miss, Combo Meter, Prosperity):** 3 days
- **Bulwark Assault Synergy + Assault Rewards:** 3 days
- **UI/FX Feedback Polish:** 2 days
- **Total to v2.0 MVP:** ~13 Days

### Post-MVP Polish (Optional)
- Dynamic weather/time-of-day cycles.
- Additional district visual states and destruction feedback.
- Extended audio feedback for rescue/deploy and mission transitions.

### What We Should Work on Next
Start with **Supply Drop Hot-Starts** because the pending inventory pipeline is already built and visible in the shop UI, but it never impacts gameplay. Once those items actually apply at mission start, the shop loop becomes meaningful and will immediately increase player power fantasy. After that, move directly into **Weapon Tier Overflow** so rescue performance feeds into squad strength and closes the core rescue-to-deploy loop.
