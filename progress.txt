# Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender

## 1. Core Concept

**Implementation Status: 78% Complete**  

### Key Themes Progress:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Urban defense gameplay with district-based missions
- Ship/foot combat transitions via pilot ejection system
- Human rescue mechanics with landers and mutants
- Escalating difficulty through wave systems and boss encounters
- **Defend and Reclaim**: Districts exist in three states (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied)
- **Squad Leader Fantasy (Core Loop):** On-foot aura, formation follow, and sacrifice/body-block behaviors
- **Active Deployment:** Humans convert into operatives when dropped at the hangar
- **Mothership Finale Structure:** Exterior boss breach transitions into an interior pilot-only boarding phase

⚠️ **Partially Implemented:**
- **Seamless transition (Ship/Foot):** Ejection + hangar rebuild + squad leader aura exist, but Bulwark/ground synergies and stronger UI messaging are missing.
- **Resource vs. Score (The Rescue Loop):** Cargo collection + deployment are in place; operative overflow scaling now routes max-tier pickups into comrade buffs with HUD/FX, but deeper squad synergy feedback loops still need polish.
- **Strategic Territory Control:** District states, timers, and prosperity investment are in; still needs tuning/balance.
- **Operative Depth:** 4 distinct classes exist with combat behaviors (Infantry, Gunner, Medic, Saboteur); Tier Overflow scaling now boosts ground troops, but stronger fire-team coordination outside of the on-foot formation is still minimal.

## MVP Completion

- **Status:** ~84% complete (core campaign, rescue/deploy loop, and phase-gated encounters are production-ready; major remaining work is assault reward identity + mode expansion).
- **Primary Blockers:** Assault-specific reward/jackpot loop, Bulwark siege payoff in assault spaces, and formal challenge-mode surfacing.

## Gap Analysis & Next Steps (Codebase Audit Refresh)

### Overall Completion Statistics
- **Design Document Alignment:** ~82%
- **Major Milestones Achieved:** Strategic district-state campaign loop, critical near-miss bonus window, rescue cargo inertia and hangar deployment loop, 4-class operative behavior suite, pilot ejection + rebuild survival loop, supply-drop shop + hot-start inventory flow, combo/flow HUD support, and multi-phase boss architecture including the full mothership route.
- **Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order):** (1) Assault rewards + jackpots, (2) Bulwark siege/structure payoff, (3) challenge mode surfacing with score persistence, (4) world reactivity (weather + destruction readability).
- **Estimated Remaining Work:** ~6-10 dev days to hit MVP feature compliance; ~3-5 additional weeks for full v2.0 design parity and polish.
- **Post-MVP Polish (Optional):** Adaptive music layering, cinematic district transition stingers, richer deployment VO/SFX variety, challenge mutators, and deeper biome hazard diversity.
- **MVP Completion:** ~85%
- **Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance:** Assault loot/jackpot identity, Bulwark structural synergy, challenge-mode packaging (Last Stand / Assault Only), and environment reactivity (weather/destruction feedback).

### Design Document Alignment
**Aligned / Implemented**
- Strategic district states with consequence pressure, critical timer logic, and prosperity loss-aversion behavior.
- Rescue-to-deploy loop (human capture, cargo inertia, hangar conversion into combat operatives).
- Interceptor/Bulwark switching and on-foot rebuild command flow.
- Operative class behaviors including saboteur utility plus overflow-based troop buffs.
- Supply Drop gacha sequence with pending inventory and mission-start hot-start application.
- Unified shield-gate cadence across bosses, battleships, assault core, and mothership core.
- Mothership mission chain with exterior encounter, interior objective stage, procedural platform/ladders traversal, and final core kill.
- Combo/flow tracking surfaced in HUD layer.

**Partially Aligned**
- Bulwark currently has strong handling identity but no explicit structural DPS/siege messaging in assault.
- Environment framework is broad (multiple biome generators), but weather, destruction readability, and reactive world-state visuals are still thin.
- Fire-team behavior works well for follow/aura/sacrifice, but persistent autonomous perimeter tactics remain shallow while the pilot is airborne.

**Not Yet Aligned (Major Remaining Gaps)**
- Assault loot rewards + mystery/jackpot outcomes tied to base destruction.
- Fully surfaced challenge modes ("Last Stand" and "Assault Only") with dedicated score loop.
- Weather/visibility systems and stronger destruction-state signaling.

### Major Milestones Achieved
- District campaign + mission routing pipeline (friendly/threatened/occupied).
- Defense and assault mission objective frameworks and phase progression.
- Hangar-centered rebuild and ejection-based second-chance gameplay loop.
- Operative deployment, class variance, and squad sacrifice/body-block behaviors.
- Supply-drop economy, unboxing UX, loot history, and hot-start integration.
- Shared phase-gated encounter architecture rolled out across major mission archetypes.
- End-to-end mothership finale sequence with staged objective beats.

### Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance
1. **Assault Rewards & Mystery Drops:** Guaranteed base-clear reward tables and jackpot outcomes with clear reward callouts.
2. **Bulwark Assault Synergy:** Structural damage multipliers/behaviors and explicit HUD/FX confirmation during assault.
3. **Challenge Mode Productization:** First-class menu access and score persistence for Last Stand + Assault Only.
4. **World Reactivity Layer:** Weather variation and stronger district destruction-state readability.

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)
1. **Implement assault reward identity (2-3 days)**  
   - Base-clear loot table and jackpot roll path.
   - Reward banner and post-mission summary entries for assault payouts.

2. **Implement Bulwark siege pass (1-2 days)**  
   - Structural damage bonus against assault objectives.
   - Live HUD/FX indicator when siege bonus is active.

3. **Ship challenge modes as selectable experiences (2-3 days)**  
   - Menu entries for Last Stand and Assault Only.
   - Score persistence/reporting for repeat runs.

4. **Add first world-reactivity slice (2-4 days)**  
   - Seeded weather/visibility variants.
   - Occupied/assaulted visual-state readability upgrades.

### Estimated Remaining Work

### MVP Completion
- **Current Progress:** ~85%
- **Remaining Critical Work:**
  - Assault rewards + jackpot loop: 2-3 days
  - Bulwark siege synergy + HUD feedback: 1-2 days
  - Challenge mode surfacing + score flow: 2-3 days
- **Total to MVP target:** ~6-10 days (including QA/balance buffer)

### Full Design Document
- **High Priority Remaining:** ~18%
  - Assault reward economy and Bulwark assault identity
  - Challenge mode implementation and progression framing
- **Medium Priority Remaining:** ~40%
  - Weather/destruction reactivity systems
  - Adaptive audio and cinematic urgency polish
  - Deeper autonomous fire-team coordination
- **Low Priority Remaining:** ~70%
  - Leaderboard/mutator expansion
  - District archetype and long-tail replay content growth

### Post-MVP Polish (Optional)
- Adaptive music layers tied to urgency and encounter phase changes.
- Cinematic transition stingers for district fail/recover/liberate events.
- Expanded deployment feedback (radio chatter sets, class-specific VO/SFX).
- Challenge mutators and richer leaderboard segmentation.
- Biome-specific hazard bundles for replay variance.

### What We Should Work on Next (New Recommendation)
**Top recommendation: complete an "Assault Identity Sprint" (Rewards + Bulwark Siege) before any new mode rollout.**  
This is the highest return-on-effort path because assault missions already have robust objective scaffolding; what they lack is emotional payoff and tactical uniqueness. Shipping rewards first and siege synergy second creates immediate player-visible differentiation and provides cleaner telemetry for challenge mode tuning.

**Proposed sequence for the next sprint:**
1. Build assault base-clear reward/jackpot backend + UI callouts.
2. Add Bulwark structural-damage logic with unmistakable siege-state feedback.
3. Run a focused assault economy + pacing balance pass.
4. Promote Last Stand/Assault Only to menu once assault loop differentiation is validated.
