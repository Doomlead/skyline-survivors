# Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender

## 1. Core Concept

**Implementation Status: 78% Complete**  

### Key Themes Progress:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Urban defense gameplay with district-based missions
- Ship/foot combat transitions via pilot ejection system
- Human rescue mechanics with landers and mutants
- Escalating difficulty through wave systems and boss encounters
- **Defend and Reclaim**: Districts exist in three states (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied)
- **Squad Leader Fantasy (Core Loop):** On-foot aura, formation follow, and sacrifice/body-block behaviors
- **Active Deployment:** Humans convert into operatives when dropped at the hangar

⚠️ **Partially Implemented:**
- **Seamless transition (Ship/Foot):** Ejection + hangar rebuild + squad leader aura exist, but Bulwark/ground synergies and stronger UI messaging are missing.
- **Resource vs. Score (The Rescue Loop):** Cargo collection + deployment are in place; operative overflow scaling now routes max-tier pickups into comrade buffs with HUD/FX, but deeper squad synergy feedback loops still need polish.
- **Strategic Territory Control:** District states, timers, and prosperity investment are in; still needs tuning/balance.
- **Operative Depth:** 4 distinct classes exist with combat behaviors (Infantry, Gunner, Medic, Saboteur); Tier Overflow scaling now boosts ground troops, but stronger fire-team coordination outside of the on-foot formation is still minimal.

## MVP Completion

- **Status:** ~74% complete (core loop intact, Mothership core fight present but simplified)
- **Primary Blockers:** Multi-phase Mothership mission, strategic pressure systems, assault rewards + bulwark siege bonuses

## Gap Analysis & Next Steps

### Overall Completion Statistics
- **MVP Completion:** ~74% (Core rescue/deploy loop, on-foot aura, and district flow are playable with supply-drop hot-starts.)
- **Design Document Alignment:** ~67% (Key systems exist, but several signature mechanics are still missing.)
- **Major Milestones Achieved:** Rescue/Deploy loop, district states, assault/defense modes, hangar rebuild, operative spawning + formation + sacrifice behaviors, supply drop unboxing + hot-start application, mothership core encounter.

### Design Document Alignment
**Aligned/Implemented**
- District state system (Friendly/Threatened/Occupied).
- Rescue-to-Deploy loop (cargo carry, inertia, hangar drop-off, operative deployment).
- Assault/Defense mission flows with hangar rebuild loop.
- On-foot squad aura + sacrifice behavior.
- Supply Drop gacha shop + hot-start delivery at mission start.
- Mothership unlock node and boss encounter.
- Explicit 30s critical near-miss window + clutch-defense bonus.
- Engagement combo meter with flow-state persistence.
- Prosperity investment loop with district value indicators + loss-aversion reset.

**Partially Aligned**
- Operative depth (classes exist; patrol behavior exists; fire-team coordination still needs polish).
- Strategic layer urgency (Threatened/Occupied exists; critical urgency exists; further prosperity feedback polish still missing).
- Bulwark form (functional, but no siege/structure bonus or UI feedback).

**Not Aligned**
- Assault rewards and mystery drops.
- Multi-phase mothership mission structure (exterior → interior → core).

### Major Milestones Achieved
- Ship/foot transition with pilot ejection and hangar rebuild.
- Cargo-based inertia and operative deployment.
- On-foot aura + body-blocking sacrifice loop.
- Assault base objective with garrisons/turrets/shield nodes.
- Supply Drop shop, unboxing, pending drop display, and mission-start hot-start application.
- Mothership node unlock and core boss flow.

### Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance
1. **Bulwark Assault Synergy:** Higher structural damage or siege bonuses.
2. **Assault Loot Rewards & Mystery Drops:** Base destruction rewards and random jackpots.
3. **Multi-phase Mothership Mission:** Exterior → interior → core progression with phase-gated objectives.

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)
**Priority 1: Bulwark Assault Synergy + Assault Rewards (2-3 Days)**
- Add structural damage bonus for Bulwark mode.
- Add assault base loot drops and mystery jackpots.

**Priority 2: Expand Mothership Final Boss Mission (4-6 days)**
- Build Phase 1 exterior assault + phase transition setup.
- Implement Phase 2 interior encounter space (on-foot focus) with objective gating.
- Upgrade Phase 3 core boss to multi-step shield/HP phases (current fight is HP-based, single arena).
- Add phase-gated UI beats and cinematic transition (dock/boarding).

**Priority 3: Feedback + UI Polish (2 Days)**
- Stronger UI/FX for operative scaling, rebuild sacrifice, and squad power-ups.


### Estimated Remaining Work

### MVP Completion:
- **Current Progress:** ~74% complete (adjusted after code audit)
- **Remaining Critical Work:**
  - Mothership Boss Mission (multi-phase upgrade): 4-6 days
  - Bulwark Assault Synergy + Assault Rewards: 2-3 days
  - Assault failure/retreat polish: 1-2 days
  - UI/FX Feedback Polish: 2 days
- **Total to v2.0 MVP:** ~14-20 Days (feature-implementation + polish)

### Full Design Document:
- **High Priority Features:** ~35% remaining
  - Assault mission polish (multi-phase core, base rewards)
  - Strategic campaign layer + planetary control tracker
  - Enhanced rewards system + post-boss presentation polish
- **Medium Priority Features:** ~60% remaining
  - Ground combat depth (operatives, weapons, cover)
  - Power-up progression tiers (homing, drone, laser)
  - Environmental variety (weather, day/night, district themes)
- **Low Priority Features:** ~85% remaining
  - Additional game modes
  - District themes
  - Challenge systems




### Post-MVP Polish (Optional)
- Dynamic weather/time-of-day cycles.
- Additional district visual states and destruction feedback.
- Extended audio feedback for rescue/deploy and mission transitions.
- Implement multi-phase core reactor.
- Add high-value power-up drops in bases.
- Polish assault difficulty scaling.
- Global difficulty scaling tied to occupied districts
- Battleship “kidnap” mechanic for shop items

### What We Should Work on Next
1. **Bulwark Assault Synergy + Assault Rewards** to differentiate assault missions and pay off the Bulwark mode fantasy.
2. **Mothership multi-phase upgrade (Exterior → Interior → Core)**. This is the single largest compliance gap and the primary MVP blocker.
3. **Assault mission retreat/redo loop polish** to clarify failure flow and reduce dead-end friction.
