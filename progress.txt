    Rapid Fire: Temporarily speeds up firing

    Speed Boost: Temporarily boosts player movement speed 

Defensive / Utility Power-Ups

    Shield: Grants a shield hit that absorbs damage

❌ **Not Implemented:**

| System | Current Implementation | Design Goal | Gap |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|-----|
| Laser | Single → Spread → Wave | Single → **Twin** → Spread → Wave Beam | Missing Twin tier |
| Force Drone | Basic only | Front → Orbit → Detached | Missing progression system |
| Shield | Basic only | Ablative segments → Timed invulnerability | Missing tier progression |
| Homing Missiles | Basic only | Basic → Swarms → Guided Barrage | Missing tier progression |
| Overdrive | Basic only | +Duration → +Damage → Screen-Filling Chaos | Missing tier progression |

#### 4.3.3. Combo Examples
**Implementation Status: 0% Complete**

❌ **Not Implemented:**
- Force Drone + Spread Laser: Rotating projectile ring synergy
- **Afterburner + Shield: "Ram Mode"** - crash into base defenses safely
- **Homing Missiles + Overdrive: Apocalypse swarm** - base siege weapon

### Recommended Implementation Path:

**Option A: Keep Current System (Simpler)**
- Laser: Tiered (Piercing → Wave progression)
- Drone: Tiered (Front → Orbit → Detached)
- All others: Single-level toggles/buffs
- **Pros**: Already implemented, simpler balance
- **Cons**: Less progression depth

**Option B: Add New Tiers (Design Document Vision)**
- Create new tiered pickup types for:
  - Shot Pattern (Single → Twin → Spread → Multi)
  - Coverage (Forward → +Rear → +Side)
  - Homing (Basic → Swarms → Barrage)
- **Pros**: Deeper progression, clearer upgrade paths
- **Cons**: Requires new pickup entities and tier tracking

**Hybrid Recommendation:**
- Keep current single-level system for most pickups
- Add Homing Missile tier progression (3 levels: Basic → Swarms → Barrage)
- Document that Shot Pattern/Coverage are achieved through collecting multiple single-level pickups
- This provides progression depth without major refactoring
