    Rapid Fire: Temporarily speeds up firing

    Speed Boost: Temporarily boosts player movement speed 

Defensive / Utility Power-Ups

    Shield: Grants a shield hit that absorbs damage

❌ **Not Implemented:**

| System | Current Implementation | Design Goal | Gap |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|-----|
| Laser | Single → Spread → Wave | Single → **Twin** → Spread → Wave Beam | Missing Twin tier |
| Force Drone | Basic only | Front → Orbit → Detached | Missing progression system |
| Shield | Basic only | Ablative segments → Timed invulnerability | Missing tier progression |
| Homing Missiles | Basic only | Basic → Swarms → Guided Barrage | Missing tier progression |
| Overdrive | Basic only | +Duration → +Damage → Screen-Filling Chaos | Missing tier progression |

#### 4.3.3. Combo Examples
**Implementation Status: 0% Complete**

❌ **Not Implemented:**
- Force Drone + Spread Laser: Rotating projectile ring synergy
- **Afterburner + Shield: "Ram Mode"** - crash into base defenses safely
- **Homing Missiles + Overdrive: Apocalypse swarm** - base siege weapon

### Recommended Implementation Path:

**Option A: Keep Current System (Simpler)**
- Laser: Tiered (Piercing → Wave progression)
- Drone: Tiered (Front → Orbit → Detached)
- All others: Single-level toggles/buffs
- **Pros**: Already implemented, simpler balance
- **Cons**: Less progression depth

**Option B: Add New Tiers (Design Document Vision)**
- Create new tiered pickup types for:
  - Shot Pattern (Single → Twin → Spread → Multi)
  - Coverage (Forward → +Rear → +Side)
  - Homing (Basic → Swarms → Barrage)
- **Pros**: Deeper progression, clearer upgrade paths
- **Cons**: Requires new pickup entities and tier tracking

**Hybrid Recommendation:**
- Keep current single-level system for most pickups
- Add Homing Missile tier progression (3 levels: Basic → Swarms → Barrage)
- Document that Shot Pattern/Coverage are achieved through collecting multiple single-level pickups
- This provides progression depth without major refactoring

## Major Milestones Achieved

### ✅ Completed Major Systems:
1. **District three-state system** - Friendly/Threatened/Occupied fully functional
2. **15-wave defense structure** - Complete with tier progression (light/heavy/elite)
3. **Assault mission core loop** - Base destruction with shields + turrets + garrison defenders
4. **Complete district state transition flow** - All win/loss outcomes implemented
5. **Battleship system** - Roaming threats + wave 15 boss fully functional
6. **Mothership unlock condition** - Activates when all districts friendly
7. **Defense/assault/liberate gameplay loop** - End-to-end campaign flow (final boss exists, multi-phase design pending)
8. **Procedural parallax environment stack** - Multi-layer sky/city/terrain backgrounds with multiple style generators
9. **Mothership assault playable** - Core arena fight with HP-based phases + reinforcements + campaign victory/defeat overlays (missing multi-phase design)
10. **Campaign victory flow** - Dedicated campaign victory overlay with stats + new campaign/menu options

### 🎯 Recent Achievements:
- ⬆️ Environmental stack: 40% → 55% (multi-layer sky/atmosphere/stars + multiple styles)
- ⬆️ Assault missions: 60% → 75% (base shields, turrets, garrison defenders, HUD)
- ⬆️ System map: 60% → 70% (complete state transition flow)
- ⬆️ Mothership assault: 10% → 30% (HP-based core phases + HUD support)
- ⬆️ Campaign victory: 0% → 100% (campaign win/defeat overlays with stats)

## Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Complete MVP (6-9 days)

**Priority 1: Expand Mothership Final Boss Mission (4-5 days)**
- Build Phase 1 exterior assault + phase transitions
- Implement Phase 2 interior encounters (on-foot focus) with objective gating
- Upgrade Phase 3 core boss to multi-step HP/shield phases (current fight is HP-based, single-arena)
- Add phase-gated UI beats and cinematic transition (dock/boarding)

**Priority 2: Assault Mission Failure Flow Polish (1-2 days)**
- Add mid-mission extraction or forced retreat prompts
- Ensure assault failure messaging and retry loop feel distinct from general game-over

**Priority 3: Integration + Balance Pass (2-3 days)**
- Full campaign playthrough testing
- Balance pass on Mothership difficulty + assault reinforcements
- Bug fixes and polish

### 📋 Post-MVP Polish (Optional)

**Phase 1: Assault Mission Depth (1 week)**
- Implement multi-phase core reactor
- Add high-value power-up drops in bases
- Polish assault difficulty scaling

**Phase 2: Strategic Layer (1 week)**
- Priority UI for district selection
- District value indicators
- Visual planetary control tracker
- Global difficulty scaling

**Phase 3: Ground Combat (2 weeks)**
- Operative squad system
- Cover mechanics
- Ground weapons variety
- Special operative roles

**Phase 4: Environment Variety (1 week)**
- District-specific background selection (tie styles to districts)
- Day/night cycle or weather modifiers

## Estimated Remaining Work

### MVP Completion:
- **Current Progress:** ~86% complete (adjusted after code audit)
- **Remaining Critical Work:**
  - Mothership Boss Mission (multi-phase upgrade): 4-5 days
  - Assault failure/retreat polish: 1-2 days
  - Testing & Polish: 2-3 days
- **Total Time to Complete MVP:** 6-8 days

### Full Design Document:
- **High Priority Features:** ~35% remaining
  - Assault mission polish (multi-phase core, base rewards)
  - Strategic campaign layer + planetary control tracker
  - Enhanced rewards system + post-boss presentation polish
- **Medium Priority Features:** ~65% remaining
  - Ground combat depth (operatives, weapons, cover)
  - Power-up progression tiers (homing, drone, laser)
  - Environmental variety (weather, day/night, district themes)
- **Low Priority Features:** ~85% remaining
  - Additional game modes
  - District themes
  - Challenge systems

## MVP Completion

- **Status:** ~86% complete (core loop intact, Mothership fight present but simplified)
- **Primary Blockers:** Multi-phase Mothership mission, assault retreat/retry polish

---

## Critical Missing Features for Design Document Compliance

### 🚨 MVP Blockers:
1. **Multi-phase Mothership final boss mission** - Needs exterior → interior → core phases
2. **Assault mission failure/retreat loop polish** - Mid-mission extraction/retreat prompts for proper occupied-district pacing

### 📋 Core Gameplay Polish:
3. **Strategic campaign layer** - Priority UI, district values, difficulty scaling
4. **Multi-phase base reactor** - Added challenge to assault missions
