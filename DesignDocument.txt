Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender
Game Design Document
Single-Player Side-Scrolling Shooter with In/Out-of-Vehicle Combat

1. Core Concept
1.1 Genre + Inspiration Blend
Stargate/Defender II (1981): wraparound side-scrolling rescue shooter core
Strike Force (1991): system map meta, district defense pressure, turret flavor
R-Type/Gradius: modular upgrade paths and weapon synergies
Vampire Survivors: escalating density, screen-filling chaos, build crafting
Blaster Master/Metal Warrior: seamless ship-to-ground transition
1.2 Setting + Premise
Player pilots an advanced strike ship defending city-arcologies (“urban planets” / districts) from alien invasion
System map provides district selection and strategic priorities
Rescue civilians/ground operatives, prevent district destruction, progress toward enemy base assault
1.3 Core Hook (Ship Loss → On-Foot Continuation)
When ship is destroyed, player ejects and continues on foot
Fight to reclaim the ship or extract safely
Blends aerial shmup + ground combat into a high-stakes survival loop

2. High-Level Structure
2.1 System View (Strike Force-Inspired)
Orbital/system map of city districts (nodes)
Enemy motherships move between nodes and initiate attacks
Player chooses which district to defend
Ignoring flashing nodes risks permanent district destruction
Single-player only
2.2 Combat View (Defender/Stargate Core)
Horizontal wraparound map above city surface
Radar/HUD displays:
Player position
Civilians/ground operatives
Enemy clusters
Pickups / special weapons
Primary loop: Rescue → Escort → Extraction
Ground units assist in combat
Ship destruction triggers on-foot transition
2.3 Meta Progression Structure
Clear enough districts to unlock enemy base assault
Lost districts increase endgame difficulty (elite enemies, tighter timers, reduced resources)
Perfect Run: save all districts → special ending/cosmetics/harder difficulty

3. Gameplay Overview
3.1 Core Parameters
Perspective: Side-scrolling shooter with wraparound
Players: Single-player
3.2 Core Loop (Run Flow)
System View: choose district to defend
Combat View:
rescue comrades
collect power-ups
survive waves
clear district
if ship destroyed → on-foot combat
Return to System View:
choose upgrades
visit Weapons Satellite (shop)
select next hotspot
After enough districts: attempt enemy base assault

4. Player Mechanics
4.1 Ship Forms & Movement
4.1.1 Normal Fighter Form
Movement: 8-directional with slight inertia; high speed traversal
Primary weapon: forward-firing blaster (based on facing)
Secondary actions:
Smart Bomb (limited screen clear)
Hyperspace/Warp (random teleport; risky)
4.1.2 Turret Mode (Single-Player Adaptation)
Activation: toggle to enter Turret Mode
Characteristics:
movement reduced to slow drift
360° aim via stick/mouse/keys
higher DPS / denser shots / special shot types
Optional variant: turret mode only on ground (post-destruction), encouraging on-foot use
4.2 On-Foot Combat (Blaster Master/Metal Warrior Integration)
4.2.1 Trigger: When Ship is Destroyed
Safe ejection (no instant death)
Transition to on-foot mode on city surface
Health carries over from ship
Continue fighting with ground weapons
Dying on foot = game over
4.2.2 Ground Combat Mechanics
Weapons:
pistol (limited ammo; medium range; fast fire)
melee (short range; high stun; stamina-based)
Movement:
slower than ship
jump + crouch
light platforming across city structures
4.2.3 Ground Objectives
Rescue comrades: touch to recruit; they follow and shoot
Pick up surface weapons/items:
shotgun, flamethrower, rocket launcher, temporary shield
Reclaim ship:
locate crashed pod (radar-marked)
interact to re-enter
ship returns to full health
power-ups do not carry over unless stored
Escape:
reach dropship zone/bunker to extract and end mission
Risk/Reward:
vulnerable but allows recovery and clutch comebacks
4.3 Comrades & Rescue System
4.3.1 Ground Operatives (Comrades)
Replace “humans” with armed operatives
Behaviors:
fight aliens with basic firearms
some operate stationary turrets/vehicles (hover bikes)
Rescue mechanics:
touch to follow and shoot
carry one at a time
deposit at safe zones for:
score bonus
currency
temporary buff (e.g., +10% damage for 30 seconds)
4.3.2 Mutation Risk (Mutant Operatives)
Process:
large aliens capture comrades and mutate them
mutated comrades become fast mutant troopers
Impact:
mutants can hijack turrets/vehicles
higher score value
rare reconversion possible (special drop/item)

5. Power-Up & Weapon System
5.1 Power Capsules (Airborne)
Dropped by specific enemies
Mechanic options:
R-Type style cycling through weapon types
OR shared upgrade bar with path selection at thresholds
5.2 Surface Weapons & Items (Strike Force-Style)
Pickups near ground / in hazards / hidden by structures
Examples:
missiles / multi-missiles
laser upgrades (range, piercing)
bomb types (cluster, carpet)
afterburner (speed)
warps (short-range teleport)
shield (timed invulnerability)
5.3 Upgrade Paths
5.3.1 Laser System
Single → Twin → Spread → Wave → Plasma Beam
5.3.2 Drone System
Fixed → Rotating → Detachable (holds lane) → Twin Drones
5.3.3 Shield Generator
1 segment → 3 segments → Temporal Shield (3s invulnerability)
5.3.4 Homing Missiles
Basic → Homing → Swarm → Smart Missiles
5.3.5 Overdrive Mode
5s → 10s → increased DPS → homing added to all weapons
5.4 Power Combinations (Synergies)
Drone + Spread Laser: close-range zone clearing
Afterburner + Shield: “Ram Mode” contact damage
Homing + Overdrive: screen-wide missile chaos

6. Environment Design
6.1 City Presentation (4-Layer Parallax)
