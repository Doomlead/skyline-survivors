Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender

1. Core Concept

    A modern reimagining of Defender/Stargate fused with Strike Force, Vampire Survivors, and Blaster Master-style vehicle/foot combat.
    Key Themes:
        Defend a network of cities (“urban planets”) from alien invasion.
        Seamlessly transition between piloting a strike ship and fighting on foot when destroyed.
        Rescue armed ground operatives to aid in combat.
        Escalating enemy density, modular upgrades, and systemic risk (district destruction).

2. High-Level Structure
2.1. System View Orbital Map

    Purpose: Strategic node selection.
    Elements:
        City districts displayed as nodes.
        Enemy motherships roam between nodes, attacking districts.
        Special nodes:
            Weapons Satellite (Shop)
            Enemy Base (Endgame)
            Optional Challenge Missions
    Mechanics:
        Select districts to defend.
        Ignoring attacks → District destruction → Permanent loss + increased difficulty.

        Rescue armed ground operatives (comrades).

        Radar HUD (Defender-style).
        Parallax cityscape with dynamic weather/day-night cycle.
