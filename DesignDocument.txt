Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender


Core Concept

A modern reimagining of the 1981 arcade classic Stargate/Defender II, fused with:

Strike Force (1991): Two-player simultaneous play, turret mode, planetary/system layer, rescue-driven meta.

R-Type / Gradius: Modular power-up paths and weapon combinations.

Vampire Survivors–style escalation: Increasingly dense waves, screen-filling chaos, build crafting.


Players pilot advanced strike ships to defend a network of cities (or “urban planets”) from alien invasion, choosing which hotspots to respond to on a system map. Save civilians and ground troops, prevent districts from being destroyed, and eventually strike the enemy’s central base.

High-Level Structure

1. System View (Strike Force-inspired):

A star-map-like view of a solar system or orbital network of city-arcologies.

Each node = a city district / “planet” under threat.

Enemy motherships move between nodes, initiating high-risk attacks.

Players choose which district to defend next; ignoring flashing nodes risks permanent destruction.



2. Side-Scrolling Combat View (Defender/Stargate core):

Classic horizontal wraparound map above a city surface.

Radar shows:

Civilians and ground operatives (comrades).

Enemy clusters.

Special weapons and pickups.


Rescue → escort → extraction loop, with ground units actively assisting in combat.



3. Meta Progression:

Clear a threshold of districts to unlock the enemy base assault.

Failing to defend too many districts makes the final base run harder (or potentially unwinnable in some modes).

Inspirations

Defender / Stargate: Wraparound, vertical scanning radar, rescue-and-defend humans, fast horizontal shmup.

Strike Force:

Two-player simultaneous co-op.

Ship can transform into a turret form with heavy firepower.

System map with multiple “planets” and a pursuing mothership.

Planet destruction risk if ignored.

Ground troops (comrades) that actively shoot enemies and can hang from your ship.

Weapon pickups scattered on the surface + weapon satellite shop.


R-Type / Gradius: Path-based upgrades, satellites/“Force” drones, layered weapons.

Vampire Survivors: Over-the-top enemy density, build variety, survival-wave pacing.


Gameplay Overview

Perspective: Side-scrolling shooter with wraparound.

Players: 1–2 simultaneous (local and/or online).

Core Loop:

1. From system view, choose a district/planet to defend.


2. Enter side-scrolling mission: rescue comrades, collect power-ups, hold the line.


3. Survive waves, clear the district, secure civilians/operatives.


4. Return to system view: choose upgrades, visit satellite shop, select next hotspot.


5. After enough cleared districts, attempt the enemy base assault.

Player Mechanics

1. Ship Forms & Movement

Normal Fighter Form

Movement: 8-directional (left/right, up/down, with slight inertia).

Speed: High, designed for rapid traversal of wide maps.

Primary weapon: Forward-firing blaster (direction depends on facing).

Secondary actions:

Smart Bomb: Limited, screen-clearing attack.

Hyperspace/Warp: Emergency teleport to a random position in the map (risk of spawning into danger).



Turret Form (Strike Force-inspired)

Any player can press a dedicated button to toggle Turret Mode:

Movement drastically reduced (slow drift).

360° aim using right stick / mouse or directional keys.

Higher firepower: denser shots, higher DPS, or special shot types.


Linked Mode (Two-player synergy):

If one player is in Fighter form and the other in Turret form:

The turret automatically attaches to the fighter’s hull (top or underside).

Fighter controls movement.

Turret controls aim and fire independently, shooting in any direction without affecting movement.


Both in Turret Mode: Optional design:

They remain independent but slow-moving, creating a defensive “anchor” point on the map.

2. Co-op Interactions

Shared smart bomb pool or individual bombs (tunable).

Shared radar; each player has a distinct marker.

Rescue scoring:

Both players can pick up comrades.

If one player is destroyed:

The other can retrieve their ejected pilot pod to quickly respawn them (or grant bonus).

3. Comrades & Rescue System (Upgraded Humans)

Ground Operatives (Comrades):

Replace simple “humans” with armed operatives.

Behavior:

Fight aliens on the ground with basic firearms.

Some comrades man stationary turrets, vehicles, or mounted weaponry.


Rescue:

Touch a comrade to pick them up.

While carried underneath the ship, they continue shooting:

Fire downwards or at nearby threats.

Acts like a dangling gun pod.

You can deposit them at safe zones (dropships, bunkers) to cash in:

Score bonus.

Currency.

Temporary or persistent buffs.

Mutation Risk (Mutant Operatives):

Certain large aliens can capture comrades and mutate them:

Mutated comrades become small agile “mutant troopers.”

They attack the player and can hijack vehicles/turrets.

Mutant kills score more, but rescuing mutated comrades is still possible for points (high risk, high reward).

Power-Up & Weapon System

1. Power Capsules & Surface Weapons

Power Capsules (airborne):

Dropped by specific enemy types.

Cycle through weapon categories (R-Type style) or add charges to an upgrade bar.

Surface Weapons & Items (Strike Force-style):

Scattered across the cityscape:

Missiles / multi-missiles.

Laser upgrades.

Bomb types (cluster bombs, carpet bombs).

Engine boosts (afterburners).

Warps (instant short-range teleports).

Shield items (ablative or timed invulnerability).


Must fly close to ground or navigate hazardous zones to collect.

2. Upgrade Paths

Laser System:

Single shot → Twin shot → Spread shot → Wave beam.

Force Drone / Combat Drone:

Orbital drone that can be:

Fixed in front.

Rotating around the ship.

Detached to hold a lane or choke point.

Shield Generator:

Ablative shield segments that can absorb a few hits.

Or timed full invulnerability.

Homing Missiles:

Funnels towards strongest nearby targets.


Overdrive:

Temporary mode where fire rate, projectile count, or damage is massively boosted.

Screen-filling chaos; perfect “panic button” or boss phase shredder.



3. Power Combinations

Example combos:

Force Drone + Spread Laser → Rotating ring of projectiles that clears nearby threats.

Afterburner + Shield → “Ram Mode”: slam into enemies to damage/kill them while protected.

Homing Missiles + Overdrive → Swarms of missiles filling the sky.


Environment Design

1. City Background (4-Layer Parallax)

Foreground:

Destroyable buildings, platforms, billboards.

Some structures hide pickups or comrades.


Mid-Ground:

Traffic, holo-signs, flying cars, crowds.

Civilians running, taking cover, reacting to destruction.


Background:

Towering skyscrapers, bridges, megastructures.

Dynamic weather (rain, lightning, storms, smog).


Sky Layer:

Day/night cycle tied to mission progression.

Weather shifts that can alter visibility or enemy silhouettes.



2. City Districts as “Planets”

Each district (planet) has a theme and unique hazards:

Downtown Core:

Dense skyscrapers, narrow corridors.

Risk of colliding with structures; ideal for turret mode covering tight lanes.


Industrial Zone:

Factories, smokestacks, cranes, toxic spills.

Moving machinery that can crush or block the player.


Residential Sector:

Parks, apartments, crowded streets.

High comrade density; more rescue opportunities but also more hostage situations.


Dockyards / Waterfront:

Ships, cranes, water surfaces.

Enemies that dive in/out of water.


Orbital Platforms (Late-game “Planets”):

Low gravity segments.

Stationary or slowly rotating platforms.

System View & Meta Layer (Strike Force Integration)

1. System Map

A stylized galactic or orbital map showing:

All city districts/planets.

Player ship(s) as a cursor.

Enemy mothership(s) moving between nodes.

Special nodes:

Weapons Satellite (shop).

Enemy Base (endgame assault).

Optional side nodes (challenge missions, bonus stages).

2. Dynamic Threats

Periodically, an enemy ship/mothership drops to a district:

District icon begins flashing.

A timer or “pressure indicator” appears.


If the players don’t select that district in time:

The district is destroyed:

Permanently lost for the run.

Increases global enemy aggression or spawns more elite enemies in remaining sectors.

If players respond in time:

They face a mini-boss version of the invading ship.


3. Weapons Satellite (Shop)

A dedicated node the players can visit between missions.

Uses run currency (score-converted or separate resource).

Purchase:

Upgrades for primary weapons and drones.

Extra smart bombs, shields, afterburners.

Temporary buffs for the next mission.

Co-op synergy items (e.g., tether beam that strengthens linked turret mode).



4. Enemy Base & Endgame

After clearing a certain number of districts:

The enemy base node becomes vulnerable on the map.

Players can choose to:

Keep clearing more districts to power up further.

Or take the risk and assault the base early.



The base mission:

Multi-phase level:

Exterior defense ring.

Interior corridors.

Final core / boss.



End conditions:

Victory: Destroy the core, end the campaign run.

Perfect Run Variant: Clear/save all districts and destroy the base for a special ending, bonus credit, or meta unlock (Strike Force homage).


Enemy Design

Classic Enemies (Reimagined)

Landers:

Abduct comrades and mutate them if not intercepted.


Mutants:

Fast, erratic movement.

Some can commandeer ground vehicles or turrets.


Bombers:

Slow-moving, heavily armored; drop bomb patterns.


Swarmers:

Small, fragile, appear in large groups to overwhelm.



New Enemies

Security Drones:

Patrol specific zones, raising alarms or calling reinforcements.


Cyber-Mutants:

Hybrid of alien tech and mutated humans.

Can blink/teleport short distances.


Giant Saurian / Kaiju Units:

Multi-hit, multi-limb bosses or mini-bosses.

Limbs can be shot off to reduce attacks (Strike Force-style mayhem).


System Map Motherships:

Appear as roaming threats on the system map.

When fought, act as mini-boss missions on the surface of a district or in low orbit.


Game Systems

Radar / HUD

Mini-radar (Defender-style):

Shows:

Player positions (1P/2P).

Comrades (blue).

Mutants (green/red).

Special pickups (white/yellow).

Mini-bosses / mothership anchors (purple).



Threat indicators:

On system map: flashing districts, destroyed worlds, base status.

In mission: off-screen arrows for high-priority targets.



Scoring & Rewards

Base points for enemy kills.

Multipliers and bonuses for:

Comrade rescues.

Comrades surviving the mission.

Mutant reconversions (if a system exists for de-mutating).

No-death runs.

District completion streaks.


Score can:

Convert to currency at end-of-mission.

Influence rank, cosmetic unlocks, and difficulty scaling.

Progression & Modes

Core Modes

1. Arcade Campaign (Strike Force-style):

50-ish districts/planets per “system”.

System map navigation, district defense, base assault.

Planets can be destroyed if ignored; this shapes each run.


2. Mission Mode:

If you’d like, next step I can:

Pull this into a clean, formatted doc outline (sections, subsections) you can drop straight into Notion/Google Docs, or

Zoom in on one specific Strike Force mechanic (e.g., turret mode or system map) and turn it into a super-detailed design spec with variables, tuning levers, and edge cases.
