Skyline Survivors: Urban Defender 
1. Core Concept
A modern reimagining of Defender/Stargate fused with Strike Force, Vampire Survivors, and Blaster Master-style vehicle/foot combat.
Key Themes:
Defend and Reclaim: Districts exist in three states - friendly, threatened, or enemy-occupied
Seamlessly transition between piloting a strike ship and fighting on foot when destroyed
Rescue armed ground operatives to aid in combat
Dynamic front lines with strategic territory control
The Hook: High-intensity "sensory jackpot" combat combined with a strategic layer that leverages Loss Aversion and Variable Reinforcement

2. High-Level Structure
2.1. System View Orbital Map
Purpose: Strategic command center showing planetary control status, using Loss Aversion to drive player priority
Elements:
City districts displayed as nodes with three states:


🟢 Friendly (Secured) - No immediate action needed
🟡 Threatened (Under Attack) - Requires defense
🔴 Occupied (Enemy Controlled) - Requires assault
District Investment Levels (Dark Pattern): Friendly districts accumulate a "Prosperity Multiplier" over time, increasing resource generation. If a district becomes Occupied, this multiplier resets to zero. This triggers Loss Aversion, making players feel a "need" to defend threatened areas to protect their investment.


The "Near-Miss" Timer (Dark Pattern): When a Threatened district timer hits zero, it enters a 30-second flashing "CRITICAL" state. Successfully starting a mission during this window grants a "Clutch Defense" bonus. Failing to do so reinforces the feeling that the player almost saved it, encouraging "just one more" attempt to prevent future losses.


Battleships roam between nodes, attacking friendly districts


Special nodes:


Weapons Satellite (Shop)
Mothership (Final Endgame Target - unlocked when all districts secured)
Optional Challenge Missions
Mechanics:
Defensive Missions: Select threatened districts to defend from 15 waves
Assault Missions: Attack occupied districts to destroy enemy ground bases
Consequence System: Ignoring threatened districts → District falls to enemy control → Becomes assault mission
Victory Condition: Secure all districts → Unlock Mothership assault

2.2. Side-Scrolling Combat View
Perspective: Horizontal wraparound map above a cityscape
Defense Missions (Threatened Districts)
Defend district from 15 waves of enemies
Rescue armed ground operatives (comrades)
Collect power-ups and defeat mini-bosses
Extract after wave 15 to secure district
Assault Missions (Occupied Districts)
Destroy all enemy forces in the district
Primary Objective: Destroy the enemy ground base
Ground base has defensive turrets, shields, and garrison forces
Success: District returns to friendly control
Failure: Retreat and retry (district remains occupied)
Key Features:
Radar HUD (Defender-style)
Parallax cityscape with dynamic weather/day-night cycle
Mission type affects enemy composition and objectives

2.3. Meta Progression
Planetary Control Tracker: Visual representation of friendly vs. occupied territories
Battleship Threat System: Roaming battleships don't just attack; they "kidnap" progress by locking away shop items or upgrades until the battleship is defeated
Mothership Unlock: Only accessible when all districts are secured (none occupied). This acts as the ultimate "completionist" hook, using the Zeigarnik Effect (the brain's tendency to remember uncompleted tasks) to keep the player focused on the "Incomplete" map
Dynamic Difficulty: More occupied districts = stronger battleship presence

2.3.1: Shop System (Replaced "Shop & Loadouts")
2.3.1. The "Supply Drop" Gacha Shop

Access Point: The Weapons Satellite / Orbit node.
Core Philosophy: Replaces the static purchase of permanent loadouts with a Variable Ratio Reinforcement model (Loot Boxes). Players spend persistent currency to gamble on "Supply Drops" that provide powerful advantages only for the immediate next deployment.

Currency:

    Meta Credits: Earned during gameplay. Used to purchase Supply Drops.
    Bank Logic: Players must decide whether to hoard credits for a difficult Assault Mission or spend them now to survive a Threatened District.

Inventory Model (Consumable "Hot Starts"):
Items obtained from the shop are single-use and apply automatically to the very next mission the player launches. They do not persist if the ship is destroyed or the mission is completed.

The Loot Boxes (Supply Pods):
Players purchase "Encryption Keys" to unlock orbital drops.

    Standard Drop (Cost: Low): High chance of Utility items, low chance of Weapon/Defense buffs.
    Elite Drop (Cost: High): High chance of Weapon Tiers, guarantees at least one tier 2 item.

Loot Table (Run-Specific Power-ups):
Instead of selecting a loadout, the box grants 1-3 random items from the entire powerup pool.

2.3.2. The Shop "Dopamine" Sequence

Visual & Audio Design (The Hook):
The purchase process is not instant; it is a dedicated "Unboxing Event" designed to spike player anticipation and gratification.

    The Trigger: When the player buys a Supply Drop, the UI fades. A cinematic view shows an orbital satellite rotating into position.
    The Build-Up (Anticipation):
        Audio: A rising mechanical turbine whine (Shepard Tone) that increases in pitch and volume.
        Visual: The satellite charges energy. The color of the energy (Blue, Purple, or Gold) teases the rarity of the item inside before it drops.
    The Drop: The pod fires downward. The camera slams down to the hangar deck.
    The Impact (The Rush):
        The pod slams into the hangar floor with a screen shake and a heavy bass THUD.
        Steam vents hiss loudly (white noise release).
    The Reveal (Jackpot):
        The pod panels explode outward.
        Visual: High-intensity "God Rays" emit from the center. If the item is high-tier, the screen flashes white, then fades in with gold confetti particles and a slow-motion rotation of the Power-Up icon.
        Audio: A high-frequency "Casino Win" chime or major chord strikes in sync with the visual flash.
    Equip Feedback: The item flies from the pod into the player's ship schematic, locking in with a satisfying metallic CLANK, confirming they are powered up for the next run.

Bouncer
Behavior: Ricochets erratically by picking a new direction every ~0.5s; fires occasionally.
Look: Orange bouncy orb with motion blur, angry eyes/eyebrows, and speed lines.
Sniper
Behavior: Positions itself for a brief setup phase; once "positioned," it stabilizes and fires high-speed shots at longer intervals.

11. Key Design Changes Summary
Previous System:
Districts only defended from attacks
Single "enemy base" endgame
Motherships were mini-bosses
New System:
Districts have three states: Friendly, Threatened, Occupied
Two mission types:
Defense: 15 waves (current gameplay)
Assault: Destroy enemy ground base
Battleships are mini-bosses that attack districts (renamed from motherships)
Mothership is the final boss (unlocked when all districts secured)
Strategic layer: Balance defending territory vs. reclaiming lost ground
Dynamic campaign: Player failure creates new challenges (occupied districts)
Clear victory path: Secure planet → Assault Mothership → Win
Psychological Engagement Systems (v2.0):
Dynamic States: Districts use Loss Aversion (Investment Levels) to increase stakes
Variable Rewards: Base rewards are randomized to create a Skinner Box loop
Sensory Polish: Feedback is tuned to "Casino-style" intensity to maximize satisfaction
Retention Mechanics: Near-miss timers and locked content ensure high replayability and "just-one-more-turn" gameplay
